# Ocean Professional Portfolio â€” Jinsho U Varkey

This project serves a complete single-page portfolio using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript located in `public/`. A minimal CRA wrapper remains for build tooling.

## Run locally

- npm install
- npm start
- Open http://localhost:3000

The site is delivered from `public/index.html` and uses:
- `public/styles.css` for styles
- `public/script.js` for interaction

## Customize
- Replace placeholder images/links with your assets.
- Update content in `public/index.html` (About, Experience, Projects, Skills, Gallery, Contact).
- Colors follow the "Ocean Professional" scheme in `styles.css`.
